# Symphony into the Stratosphere

## Description
This musical piece, generating using SonicPi, aims to invoke the feelings of relaxation I, being someone who isn't afraid of flying, experiences when I am in an airplane. In my Symphony into the Stratosphere, I tried to capture the calming white noise of airplane mechanisms and the serenity provided by being so far away from the chaos down on Earth.

The piece begins with airplane announcement and taking off engine sounds. Then, there is white noise to simulate the various mechanisms of the plane. On top of the ambience, I employed a dreamy chord progression and bass melody to depict the ethereal feeling of flying in a plane at night. To wrap of the experience, I encoded landing sounds to make the song feel like a satisfying, complete experience.
